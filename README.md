# Netflix
Hello there I'M Thilak, I have created a Netflix project which involves analyzing a dataset of Netflix content, providing insights the analysis aims to explore trends in the Netflix catalog, identify popular content categories, and uncover patterns in content releases over time.
The dataset was analyzed using SQL, and multiple queries were written to extract meaningful insights and facilitate decision-making regarding content strategy and preferences.

Project Description This project provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix's content database. By querying and manipulating the data, the project identifies key trends in content types, directors, actors, and country-specific releases. It also categorizes content based on thematic elements found in their descriptions (e.g., "Kill" and "Violence").

Key Insights: Breakdown of the number of movies vs. TV shows in the dataset. The most common ratings for movies and TV shows. Top 5 countries with the most Netflix content. Identification of the longest movies available. Categorization of content as "Good" or "Bad" based on specific keywords in the description (e.g., "Kill", "Violence"). Analysis of actors with the highest number of appearances in Indian Netflix content. Insights into content trends by year, focusing on India and globally.
